# Recruitment

As an adventurer becomes more established in their world it is only inevitable that they
come across followers who wish to join them and emulate their successes.

Followers might be bards who tell the stories of the character's conquests, warriors who fight for the same cause
or priests who have come to join them in their worship.

<div class='descriptive'>
Followers are not intended to directly join the party but instead be working towards their own goals,
possibly their own adventures, which align with the desires of the player.

## Optional Class Features

### Recruitment



_10th-level feature_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

When you reach this level, regardless of your class or classes, you can start to recruit followers.

Followers start at 1st-level and have the statistics of a Sidekick,
detailed in [Tasha's Cauldron of Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#Sidekicks).

Some examples of a Sidekicks are:

- A Spellcasting sidekick with the _Role_ of Healer who worships the same diety as you;
devoting their time to prayer and the upkeep of your diety's local Temple.

- An Expert sidekick proficient in persuasion who tracks down rare and magical items and reagents
necessary for your adventures.

- A Spellcasting sidekick with the _Role_ of Mage who has studied a school of magic under your guidance
and is now capable of their own research as well as undertaking adenturing tasks you have assigned them.

##### Required investment
| Follower level | Funding |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | 50gp |
| Each level beyond 1st | additional 50gp |


Beyond what is required as a minimum, any additional investment increases the likelihood
that your followers survive to gain higher levels and achieve your goals.

- A Warrior sidekick leading a group of followers into a dungeion may be provided with
a [_**weapon of warning**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/weapon-of-warning),
or similar magic item, to increase their survivability.
- A Spellcaster sidekick with the Mage _Role_ can be supplied with the materials
necessary to copy new spells into their spellbook.
- An Expert sidekick performing an act of burglary on your behalf could be
given a [_**potion of invisibility**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-invisibility)
to increase their chance of success.

### Wild Guide

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to guide any followers within 50 miles of you on their travels.
For the next 8 hours they can travel twice as far across any natural ground and ignore difficult terrain.

Your Wild Guide might take the form of a series of bird calls that guide your followers to the clearest paths of a  forest,
a steady, sweet smelling, breeze that blows across fields towards a hidden mountain path
or an anmial spirit that travels with the group as long as they remain out of combat.

### Eldritch vision

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Calling on the gifts of your pact, you bestow a vision to a follower of your choice.
The vision provides information that the follower otherwise would not know in as much detail,
or possibly not at all.

Using the vision you can guide the follower to a location otherwise hard to find,
guide the follower in how to approach a task, such in combatting a foe, or any other visual depiction.


Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you have completed a long rest.

### Eldritch Invocation Options

When you choose eldritch invocations, you have access to these additional options.

#### Patron of this world

_Prerequisite: 15th-level warlock; at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Rather than wait until your patron extends an offer to those you have recruited,
you strike a bargain with a follower of your choice and become their patron.
Their arcane research and the magic bestowed by you increase, or otherwise grant, them facility with spells.

The creature gains a level, becoming a sidekick Spellcaster with the _Role_ of Prodigy.
Any previous features of another type of sidekick are replaced by those gained as a Prodigy.
Any existing weapon, armour and tool proficiencies remain and the follower retains all gear and equipment.

The Prodigy chooses their spells from the warlock spell list.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

As patron of this follower:
- You have advantage on Charsima ability checks, made to guide or convince your Prodigy provided that they can see or hear you.

> #### Prodigy Example: _Amafey_
> Amafey has been following the Fathomless Warlock, Luth, for a few tendays and awakes to the strange sensation of an offer of a pact with Luth.
>
> Upon accepting - her statistics remain unchanged - she takes two cantrips from the warlock spell list: [_**booming blade**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/booming-blade) and [_**eldritch blast**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/eldritch-blast). Amafey also takes a 1st-level spell, from the warlock spell list: [_**hex**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hex).
