# Recruitment

As an adventurer becomes more established in their world it is only inevitable that they
find followers who wish to join them and emulate their successes.

Followers may be bards who tell the stories of the character's conquests, warriors who fight for the same cause
or priests who have come to join them in their worship.

Followers are not intended to directly join the party but instead be working towards their own goals,
possibly adventuring quests, which align with the desires of the player.

Unlike the features in the Player’s Handbook, you don’t gain the features here automatically.

## Optional Class Features

### Recruitment

_Nth-level feature_

Once you reach this level you can start to recruit followers.

Followers start at 1st-level and have the statistics of a Sidekick,
detailed in [Tasha's Cauldron of Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#Sidekicks).

Some examples of a Sidekicks are:

- A Spellcasting sidekick with the _Role_ of Healer who worships the same diety as you;
devoting their time to prayer and the upkeep of your diety's local Temple.
- An Expert sidekick proficient in persuasion who tracks down rare and magical items and reagents
necessary for your adventures.
- A Spellcasting sidekick with the _Role_ of Mage who has studied a school of magic under your guidance
and is now capable of their own research as well as undertaking adenturing tasks you have assigned them.

Followers you recruit that have existing statistics detailed in a stat block can be recruited,
but must be approved by your DM.

# Warlock

When you choose eldritch invocations, you have access to these additional options.

### Wordly Patron

_Prerequisite: 15th-level warlock; at least one recruited follower_

Rather than wait until your patron extends an offer to your follower,
you strike a bargain with a follower of your choice and becomes their patron.

Their arcane research and the magic bestowed by you have given them facility with spells.

The creature gains the statistics of a 1st-level sidekick Spellcaster with the _Role_ of Prodigy;
they choose their spells from the warlock spell list.

The Prodigy knows two cantrips and one 1st-level spell of their choice from its spell list.

As patron of this follower you can:
- Communicate with your Prodigy via telepathy and visions, whilst you are on the same plane of existence.
