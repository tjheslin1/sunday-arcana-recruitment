# Recruitment

As an adventurer becomes more established in their world, it is likely that they
come across followers who wish to join them and follow in their success.

Followers might be bards who tell the stories of the character's conquests, warriors who fight for the same cause
or priests who have come to join them in their beliefs.

<div class='descriptive'>
The rules outlined here are intended for followers who persue their own goals, possibly their own adventures, which align with the desires of the player; not in joining the party directly.
</div>

## Optional Class Features

### Recruitment

_10th-level feature_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

When you reach this level, regardless of your, class or classes, you can start to recruit followers.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Followers start at 1st-level and have the statistics of a sidekick,
detailed in [Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (TCoE)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#Sidekicks).

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Some example followers are:

- A Spellcasting sidekick with the _Role_ of Healer who worships the same diety as you;
devoting their time to prayer and the upkeep of your diety's local Temple.

- An Expert sidekick proficient in persuasion who tracks down rare and magical items and reagents
necessary for your adventures.

- A Spellcasting sidekick with the _Role_ of Mage who has studied a school of magic under your guidance
and is now capable of their own research as well as undertaking adenturing tasks you have assigned them.

Before a follower can set out on their first task, they will require investment to cover the cost
daily expensive such as food and lodging, travel, adventuring gear, etc.

##### Required starting investment
| Follower level | Funding |
|:----:|:-------------:|
| 1st  | 50gp |
| Each level beyond 1st | additional 50gp |

# Creating a follower

The Dungeon Master's Tools chapter of
[Tasha's Cauldron of Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#CreatingaSidekick)
has the full guide on creating a sidekick. Below is a rough and quick guide to creating each type of sidekick.

<div style='margin-top:50px'></div>

<div class='descriptive'>
As a 1st-level sidekick, their hit points should be 1d8 (or 1d6 for a Small character) + their constitution modifier (minumum of 1).
</div>

## Expert

Start with the statistics of a [_**Scout**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/scout),
removing _**Keen Hearing and Sight**_ and _**Multiattack**_.

Keep their physical and mental attributes unchanged or roll new statistics (3d6 per attribute).
Choose an appropriate Humanoid type and alignment.

As a 1st-level Expert, they gain saving throw, skill, weapon and armour proficiencies according to
[Bonus Proficienies (TCoE)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#BonusProficiencies).

The Expert has the 1st-level [_**Helpful**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#Helpful) feature.

## Spellcaster

Start with the statistics of an [_**Acolyte**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/acolyte).

Keep their physical and mental attributes unchanged or rolling new statistics (3d6 per attribute).
Choose an appropriate Humanoid type and alignment.

As a 1st-level Spellcaster, they gain saving throw, skill, weapon and armour proficiencies according to
[Bonus Proficienies (TCoE)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#BonusProficiencies1).

Decide the Spellcaster's _Role_: Mage, Healer or Prodigy, and choose the Spellcaster's known spells from an appropriate class list, detailed in in the [Spellcasting Table (TCoE)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#SpellcastingTable).

## Warrior

Start with the statistics of a [_**Hobgoblin**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin),
removing _**Darkvision**_ and _**Martial Advantage**_.

Keep their physical and mental attributes unchanged or rolling new statistics (3d6 per attribute).
Choose an appropriate Humanoid type and alignment.

As a 1st-level Warrior, they gain saving throw, skill, weapon and armour proficiencies according to
[Bonus Proficienies (TCoE)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#BonusProficiencies2).

Choose a Martial Role: Attack or Defender.

> #### Warrior Example: _Amafrey_
> Amafrey starts with the statistic of a Hobgoblin. Her statistics are rerolled to: 9,13,9,18,9,9.
> She is a Humanoid (Human), neutral good.
>
> She gains proficiency in Constitution saving throws, Athletics and Nature,
all armour as well as simple and martial weapons.
>
> Amafrey chooses Defender as her Martial Role.

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

## Beyond 1st-level

Like any adventurer, followers learn and gain levels.

The DM is free to choose how to track the levels of followers.

If tracking experience points, the DM may prefer to follow this method.
Otherwise, milestone based progression is a convenient way of tracking follower progression.

Both success and failure provide experience, as such treat all completed adventures
as worthy of granting experience or progressing in milestones.

### Optional: Milestone progression by task

The following table below assumes that a completed adventure is a mostly equal match between
Adventure CR and follower level/Party level.

The table deals with a count of individual adventuring tasks, of which an adventure may be comprised of many.

For example, an adventure may have been comprised of an exploration task to find a hidden location
and a combat enounter to deal with a group of enemies.

##### Suggested milestone progression
| Follower/Party level | Total number of adventurering tasks completed |
|:----:|:-------------:|
|  1st  |  0 |
|  2nd  |  2 |
|  3rd  |  5 |
|  4th  |  9 |
|  5th  | 14 |
|  6th  | 20 |
|  7th  | 27 |
|  8th  | 35 |
|  9th  | 44 |
| 10th  | 54 |

<div style='margin-top:400px'></div>

> #### Adventure Example: Amafrey's Epic
> Amafrey and company are tasked with dealing with a group of Bandits
> and retrieving what they stole.
>
> Finding the Bandits, in hiding, requires the Party explore the wilderness
> the Bandits are believed to be held out in.
>
> Once found, Amafrey and company face tough negotations with the Bandits,
> as the Player character they follow issued strict instructions not to fight the Bandits.
>
> <div style='margin-top:0px'></div>
>
> **Tip**: Since both success and failure provide experience,
> if the Party failed to come to an agreement with the Bandits,
> they are still eligible for a completed Social Interaction task
> to reflect their efforts and attempt; failure is a good teacher.
>
> <div style='margin-top:0px'></div>
>
> With the adventure complete, the Party now have two adventuring tasks under the belt.
> This would be enough to advance them to 2nd-level.

# Follower adventures

Followers might be encouraged to devote their time to trade, selling magic items aquired by the player,
or hunting down a desired artifact; prayer at a local temple, in service to your shared diety; study,
at an office established by the player or a university; or any other task that the player
has deemed a worthy endeavour for them.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Followers not dedicated to a task such as these will likely spend their time
adventuring. Their quests typically asigned by the player they follow and aligned with their goals.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Followers may adventure to:

- Track down and eliminate a group of goblins that fled during their last encounter with the player.

- Scout an area in search of a shrine or enemy encampment.

- Deliver a message of ill omen on behalf of the player.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>  

## Step by step: Building an adventure

Below is a step-by-step guide to building a follower adventure.

Subsequent sections will go into detail of each step.

<div class='descriptive'>
Adventures undertaken by the followers are not intended to be played out.

Instead, the DM should roll a d100, factoring in modifiers based on difficulty and preparation, to determine the outcome once enough time has passed for the followers to likely have completed their task.
</div>

### Step 1: Party level

Determine *Party level* by taking the average level of the group, rounded down, with a minimum of 1.

### Step 2: Adventure challenge rating

Determine the challenge rating (CR) of the adventure.

Example Exploration and Social Interaction adventures are outlined for comparison.

### Step 3: Adventure difficulty modifier

Calculate the adventure difficulty modifier using the *Party level* and Adventure CR:

<div style='margin-top:0px; margin-left:20px; font-family:consolas'>Adventure modifier = 10 x (Party level - Adventure CR)</div>

When the *Party level* matches the Adventure CR, the difficult modifier is 0.

<div style='margin-top:400px'></div>

### Step 4a: Follower items modifier

Account for any magic items in the Party's possession that would like help them in their adventure.

A set of non-magical adventuring gear, above 75gp, that would also be useful, counts as a _follower item_.

Refer to the **Provided follower items** table in [Preparation](#p8) for calculating the _Follower item modifier_.

### Step 4b Player investment modifier

Account for any coin provided to the Party to aid in their adventure.

Coin allows the followers to live comfortably on their travels, pay for food,
repairs and covers other adventuring costs such as bribing for information.

Refer to the **Player investment** table in [Preparation](#p8) for calculating the _Player investment modifier_.

**Tip**: All provided coin is assumed to have been spent in aid of successfully completed follower adventures.

### Step 5: Final modifier

Determine the final roll modifier. Start with the positive _Follower item modifier_ in addition to the player monetary investment modifier.

Then add or subtract, depending on the challenge the followers will be facing, the adventure difficulty modifier:

<div style='margin-top:0px; margin-left:20px; font-family:consolas; font-size: 11px;'>Final modifier = <br />Follower item modifier + Player investment modifier + Adventure modifier</div>

### Step 6: Adventure takes place

The DM decides when the adventure has concluded; this could be an hour after the adventure began, or possibly months later.

### Step 7: Outcome

The DM rolls to determine the outcomes of the adventure.

It is possible that the roll results in the adventure being delayed. In which case the DM should roll again after the delay has passed.

The DM decides the fate of the followers and their adventure. The DM may choose to follow on **Follower adventure outcome** table in Appendix A, which detail rewards and ramifications based on the adventure conclusion.

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

## Party level

To calculate the *Party level* of a group of followers, take the average level of the group, rounded down, with a minimum of 1.

**Tip**: when the party's level matches the Adventure challenge rating, the difficult modifier is 0.

## Adventure challenge ratings

Some follower adventures will have a clear challenge rating.
If a task set to a group of followers was originally designed for players,
the group will have a good chance of succeeding if they are of the same level that the encounter was expecting.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Not all adventures will be this clear to determine their difficulty;
the below tables contain example scenarios of social interaction, combat and exploration adventures to compare to.

##### Exploration Adventure
| Challenge rating | Example description |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1 | Explore a ruin. |
| 2 | Explore a dungeon, possibly with a few traps non lethal traps. |
| 3 | Explore, and map, an area of wilderness; identifying local fauna and flora as well as any structures. |
| 4 | Complete any, or all, of the above whilst remaining undetected.|

##### Social Interaction Adventure
| Challenge rating | Example description |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1 | Deliver a simple message to a known creature at a known, safe location. |
| 2 | Deliver a persuasive message to a known creature at a known, safe location. |
| 3 | Deliver a threatening or deceitful message to a known creature at a known, safe location. |
| 4 | Successfully convince, or manipulate, a local leader. |

##### Combat Adventure
Since combat in a follower adventure is not intended to be played out, the DM is free to set an appropriate challenge rating based on the expected resistance the followers would face.

For example, followers tasked with clearing out a haunted house full of Ghosts would face a greater challenge than those tasked with driving away a group of Goblins. As such the CR of the combat encounter would be higher.

If the followers are destined to face a combat encounter originally intended for Player characters, the challenge rating should be based on the expected level of the Player characters, adjusted for party size.
This can quickly be determined by reviewing the expected level that the Player's would expect to face certain monsters, or the level they would be expected to be in a certain area.

If the DM wants to build a specific encounter for the followers to face, tables for calculcating CR have
been outlined in the **XP Thresholds by Character Level** table in the [Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures#XPThresholdsbyCharacterLevel) and the **Solo Monster Challenge Rating** table of [Xanathar's Guide to Everything (XgtE)](Solo Monster Challenge Rating).

### A Combination?

If the intended task requires two, or even all three of the pillars of adventure,
the challenge rating of the overall adventure should either be equal to the highest individual challenge rating, if this takes up a significant propoprtion of the parties time; or an average, rounded up, of the individual tasks that comprise the adventure.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Unraveling a mystery in a quiet town, for example, might involve gathering information from the local residents (Social),
finding a nearby cave (Exploration) and finishing off the adventure with a fight against the perpetrators (Combat).

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

## Adventure difficulty

Followers might be pitted against challenges that they could very likely overcome, given their levels. Likewise followers might be assigned a task far beyond their capabilities, perhaps out of necessity.

When the party's level does not match the challenge rating of the adventure, an additional adventure roll modifier comes into play.

##### Adventure difficultymodifier
| Party level | modifier |
|:----:|:-------------:|
| 1  | 10 x (1 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |
| 2  | 10 x (2 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |
| 3 | 10 x (3 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |
| 4 | 10 x (4 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |
| 5 | 10 x (5 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |
| 6 | 10 x (6 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |
| 7 | 10 x (7 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |
| 8 | 10 x (8 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |
| 9 | 10 x (9 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |
| 10 | 10 x (10 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |

> ##### Party size?
>
> The exact number of followers is not factored into the _Adventure difficulty_ calculation.
>
> It is assumed that an appropriate number of followers approach the task.
>
> If too few, or too many, followers are sent on a task, consider adjusting the difficulty proportionally.
> Instead, you could treat result as an auto-success, or auto-failure.

<div style='margin-top:400px'></div>

> ##### Amafrey's first adventure
> Amafrey, a 2nd-level Spellcaster, is adventuring with three companions, all of 1st-level; their party level is 1.
>
> <div style='margin-top:0px; margin-left:20px; font-family:consolas'>(2 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 1.25 = 1</div>
>
> The party have been tasked with locating a shrine known to be hidden in a nearby, relatively safe, forest. The challenge rating of this exploration adventure is 2.
>
> Party level 1 and Adventure challenge rating 2 results in:
>
> <div style='margin-top:0px; margin-left:20px; font-family:consolas'>10 x (1 - 2) = -10</div>
>
> The relatively challenging task of locating this shrine adds a -10 (negative) modifier to the d100 roll to determining the outcome.
>
> <div style='margin-top:0px'></div>
>
> **Tip**: This negative modifier can be offset by _player investment_ and _provided equipment_.

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

## Preparation

Preparation is often key to the success of an adventure, without which followers might meet an untimely,
and quick, end.

Luck also plays an element, but can be influenced in the right, or wrong,
direction.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Beyond the [Required starting investment](#p2), any additional investment increases the likelihood
that followers survive to achieve your goals and gain higher levels.

### Follower item

A _follower item_ is a magic item, or a set of non-magical adventuring gear, above 75gp in value which followers could likely utilise on an adventure to increases their overall chance of success.

These could be newly provided or items that the followers are already in the possession of.

Unlike Player investement of coin, with the exception of consumables, _follower items_ remain in the possession of the follower adventurers unless explicitly lost or destroyed.

##### Provided follower items
| Adventure roll modifier | Number of _follower items_ |
|:----:|:-------------:|
| -5 | 0 |
| +5 | 1 |
| +10 | 2 |
| +15 | 3 |
| +20 | 4+ |

- A Warrior sidekick leading a group of followers into a dungeon could be provided with
a [_**potion of healing**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing) and [_**weapon of warning**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/weapon-of-warning), to increase their survivability.
- A Spellcaster sidekick with the _Role_ of Mage might be supplied with the materials
necessary to copy new spells into their spellbook.
- An Expert sidekick performing an act of burglary on your behalf could be
given a [_**potion of invisibility**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-invisibility)
to increase their chance of success.

<div style='margin-top:400px'></div>

> #### Example: Amafrey's follower items
> Amafrey and company are in possession of one of a pair of [Sending Stones](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/sending-stones).
> Through which they communicate with the Player character they follow.
>
> For most adventures this particular magic item would not count towards the number of _follower items_ in the Party's possession
> as it does not provide a tangible benefit for most adventures.
>
> <div style='margin-top:0px'></div>
>
> Their supplied [Potion of Healing (Greater)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing-greater)
> and Amafrey's [Breastplate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/breastplate) (being over 75gp in value) both count as _follower items_.
>
> This would grant them a +10 to the _Follower item modifier_.

### Player investment

When, and where, possible, followers will use any coin provided to prepare themselves with items such a rations and potions, unless directed to do otherwise.

The more the player invests in the adventure, the more likely it will be successful.

<div class='descriptive'>
To reduce tracking of funds, and overall simplicity, assume followers have spent all of their coin upon returning from an adventure.

This expenditure covers their preparation ahead of the adventure as well as costs incurred during,
such as sustenance, lodging and any money utilised to achieve the goal of the adventure, such as bribing a guard to let them pass.
</div>

##### Player investment
| Adventure roll modifier | Player investment |
|:----:|:-------------:|
| -5 | None |
| +5 | _Adventure challenge rating_ x 5gp |
| +10 | _Adventure challenge rating_ x 25gp |
| +20 | _Adventure challenge rating_ x 50gp |

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

## Outcome

### Success or failure?

To determine the success or failure of a follower's adventure, when the Dungeon Master (DM) deems that a suitable amount of time has passed for the adventure to have finished, roll on the approprite table below.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Modifiers to the roll include: [Player investment](#p5), [Provided equipment](#p5) and [Adventure difficulty](#p7).

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

> ##### Example
> A group of followers is close to completing their Challenge Rating 1 adventure.
>
> To track their progress the DM rolls a d100, with a result of 56. With a 56 the party
> are going to fail their adventure and have to roll on the _Adventure Failure_ table.
>
> The player has, however, prepared them.
>
> With an investment pf 20gp they gain a +5 and they have been given one _follower item_ which gives them a further +5.
>
> <div style='margin-top:0px; margin-left:20px; font-family:consolas'>56 + 5 + 5 = 66</div>
>
> With a 66 the party live to adventure for another day! Their adventure is instead delayed by d4 days, after which time the DM can roll another d100, adding the same +10 modifier.

<div style='margin-top:120px'></div>

<div class='wide'>

##### Follower adventure result: Challenge 0-4
| d100 | Result |
|:----:|:-------------|
| < 60 | Task not completed. Optionally, roll on the _Adventure failure: Challenge 0-4_ table in [Appendix A](#p10) |
| 60-70 | Adventure is delayed by d4 (2) days. |
| > 70 | Task completed. Optionally, roll on the _Adventure success: Challenge 0-4_ table in [Appendix A](#p10) |

##### Follower adventure result: Challenge 5-10
| d100 | Result |
|:----:|:-------------|
| < 70 | Task not completed. Optionally, roll on the _Adventure failure: Challenge 5-10_ table in [Appendix A](#p10) |
| 70-80 | Adventure is delayed by d8 (4) days. |
| > 80 | Task completed. Optionally, roll on the _Adventure success: Challenge 5-10_ table in [Appendix A](#p10) |

# Interacting with followers

## Optional Class Features

## Artificer

### Ingenious scheme

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Just as followers of yours are about to set out on an adventure, you are struck with an ingenious idea.

You can use _Flash of Genius_ to direct followers to take an otherwise unthought of strategy.

When you do so your follower, or followers, have a chance of completing their adventure in less time.

The DM should factor this in when determining how long the adventure takes. Also, if rolling on a _Follower adventure result_ table, if the roll results in _"Adventure is delayed by..."_,
you may reroll, adding your Artificer level as an adventure roll modifier.

You cannot benefit from _Ingenious scheme_ more than once per adventure.

## Barbarian

### Motivated by fear

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can spend a usage of rage to... inspire... one of your followers to succeed in their next adventure.

The degree of success of the followers next adventure is improved. For example, tasked with killing a group of Orcs, the inspired follower is able to eliminate an escaping Orc, intent on call for help.

Also, if rolling on one of the _Follower adventure outcome_ tables in [Appendix A](#p10), you can reroll; you must keep the new role.

A failed adventure cannot be turned into a success through *Motivived by fear* , only the outcome of a successful adventure can be improved.

## Bard

### Influential network

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You have vouched for a follower of your choice to join a network of bards that can be used to gather,
and propagate, information.

The challenge rating of Social-based adventures this follower takes part in,
whilst a member of this network, is decreased by 1.

The influential network might spread misinformation to spook a villain out of hiding;
improve the reputation of individuals that might be running for an election;
or increase the chances of a group obtaining a prized mission when there are multiple
parties interested in receiving the exclusive contract.

## Cleric

### Channel Divinity: Unbreakable devotion

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can use your Channel Divinity to reassert the benefits of devotion to your diety.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and followers that can see or hear you within 30 feet
are bolstered with a divine confidence.

With this inpsiration your followers will not leave their party out of fear,
possiblly as a result when rolling on an _Adventure failure_ table in [Appendix A](#p10), during their next adventure.

## Druid

### Wild guide

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to guide followers within 50 miles of you on their travels.
For the next 8 hours they can travel twice as far across any natural ground and ignore difficult terrain.

Your Wild Guide might take the form of a series of bird calls that guide your followers to the clearest paths through a forest, a steady, sweet smelling, breeze that blows across fields towards a hidden mountain pass
or an anmial spirit that travels with the group for as long as they remain out of combat.

## Fighter

### Party strategist

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

A follower of yours has received martial training, including how to strategise.

With this guidance they are an ideal candidate as strategist of their party,
and as such the party tends to be more organised, and successful.

The challenge rating of Combat-based adventures this follower takes part in is decreased by 1.

## Monk

## Rogue

### Unreported adventure

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can direct a follower of your choice to undertake a solo adventure,
drawing from your experience to guide them to success without the reliance of others.

Due to the subtle nature of this kind of mission, you can only have one unreported adventure
in motion at any one time.

An unreported adventure has the same chance of success as a if a small group of followers undertook this mission,
unless the task would suffer significantly, such as requiring multiple events to take place at the same time
in different locations.

An unreported adventure might take the form of an undercover, intelligence gathering mission;
an assassination or burglary; or travel to a location that requires stealth.

## Sorcerer

You can cast [_**dream**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dream) once,
targeting one of your followers without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

#### Patron of this world

_Prerequisite: 15th-level warlock; at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can take this eldritch invocation multiple times.
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You strike a bargain with a follower of your choice and become their patron.
You grant them facility with spells.

The creature gains a level, becoming a sidekick Spellcaster with the _Role_ of Prodigy.
Any previous features of another type of sidekick are replaced by those gained as a Prodigy.
Any existing weapon, armour and tool proficiencies remain, with the exception of heavy armour proficiency. The follower retains all gear and equipment.

Having taken this pact with the player, the Prodigy chooses their spells from the warlock spell list.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

As patron of this follower:
- You have advantage on Charsima ability checks made to guide or convince your Prodigy provided that they can see or hear you within 60 feet.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You cannot change this eldritch invocation whilst you have a pact with a follower.
If the Prodigy you have made a pact with dies, from the next day you can offer the pact from this eldritch invocation to
another of your followers.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Taking this invocation multiple times allows the warlock to be the patron of multiple followers.

> #### Prodigy Example: _Amafrey_
> Amafrey has been following the Fathomless Warlock, Luth, for a few tendays; she has the statistics of a 1st-level Warrior sidekick. Amafrey awakes to the strange sensation of an offer of a pact with Luth.
>
> Upon accepting she gains a level and is now a 2nd-level Spellcaster (Prodigy) sidekick.
>
> Amafrey's saving throw proficiency changes from Constitution to Charisma and her skill proficiencies are now: History and Investigation.
>
> Amafrey retains her proficiency with her longsword and medium armour and takes two cantrips from the warlock spell list: [_**booming blade**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/booming-blade) and [_**eldritch blast**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/eldritch-blast).
>
> She also takes two 1st-level spell from the warlock spell list: [_**armor of agathys**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/armor-of-agathys) and [_**hex**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hex).

<!-- [The HitPoints section of chapter 1 of the MM (https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/introduction#HitPoints)].
suggest that a Small creature should have a hit die of d6. Looking at a halfling stat block such as https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/manafret-cherryport confirms this.

Whilst the Expert stat block (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/expert) states a d8 it also states a Medium humanoid.

Going by the idea of reworking an existing stat block into a sidekick I think it's safe to assume this has been done for Cade, the Halfling.
