# Recruitment

As an adventurer becomes more established in their world, it is inevitable that they
come across followers who wish to join them and follow in their success.

Followers might be bards who tell the stories of the character's conquests, warriors who fight for the same cause
or priests who have come to join them in their worship.

<div class='descriptive'>
Followers are not intended to directly join the party but instead be working towards their own goals -
possibly their own adventures - which align with the desires of the player.
</div>

## Optional Class Features

### Recruitment

_10th-level feature_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

When you reach this level, regardless of your, class or classes, you can start to recruit followers.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Followers start at 1st-level and have the statistics of a sidekick,
detailed in [Tasha's Cauldron of Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#Sidekicks).

<div class='descriptive'>
With approval of your DM, followers you recruit can start beyond 1st-level and/or have existing statistics detailed in a stat block.
</div>

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Some example followers are:

- A Spellcasting sidekick with the _Role_ of Healer who worships the same diety as you;
devoting their time to prayer and the upkeep of your diety's local Temple.

- An Expert sidekick proficient in persuasion who tracks down rare and magical items and reagents
necessary for your adventures.

- A Spellcasting sidekick with the _Role_ of Mage who has studied a school of magic under your guidance
and is now capable of their own research as well as undertaking adenturing tasks you have assigned them.

<div style='margin-top:200px'></div>

Before a follower can set out on their first task, they will require an investment to cover the cost
daily expensive such as food and lodging, travel, adventuring gear, etc.

##### Required starting investment
| Follower level | Funding |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | 50gp |
| Each level beyond 1st | additional 50gp |

# Creating a follower

The Dungeon Master's Tools chapter of
[Tasha's Cauldron of Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#CreatingaSidekick)
has the full guide on creating a sidekick. Below is a rough and quick guide to creating a sidekick of each type.

## Expert

Start with the statistics of a [_**Scout**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/scout),
removing _**Keen Hearing and Sight**_ and _**Multiattack**_, with hit points equal to 11 (2d8 + 2),
and keeping their physical and mental attributes unchanged or rolling new statistics (3d6 per attribute).
Choose an appropriate Humanoid type and alignment.

As a 1st-level Expert, gain saving throw, skill, weapon and armour proficiencies according to
[Bonus Proficienies (TCoE)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#BonusProficiencies).

The Expert has the [_**Helpful**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#Helpful) feature.

## Spellcaster

Start with the statistics of an [_**Acolyte**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/acolyte),
keeping their physical and mental attributes unchanged or rolling new statistics (3d6 per attribute).
Choose an appropriate Humanoid type and alignment.

As a 1st-level Spellcaster, gain saving throw, skill, weapon and armour proficiencies according to
[Bonus Proficienies (TCoE)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#BonusProficiencies1).

The Spellcaster's known spells are replaced by those from a class list, in the [Spellcasting Table (TCoE)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#SpellcastingTable) dependant on the chosen _Role_: Mage, Healer or Prodigy,
as is the spellcasting ability.

## Warrior

Start with the statistics of a [_**Hobgoblin**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin),
removing _**Darkvision**_ and _**Martial Advantage**_, and keeping their physical and mental attributes
unchanged or rolling new statistics (3d6 per attribute). Choose an appropriate Humanoid type and alignment.

As a 1st-level Warrior, gain saving throw, skill, weapon and armour proficiencies according to
[Bonus Proficienies (TCoE)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/dungeon-masters-tools#BonusProficiencies2).

Choose a Martial Role: Attack or Defender.

<div style='margin-top:200px'></div>

> #### Warrior Example: _Amafrey_
> Amafrey starts with the statistic of a Hobgoblin. Her statistics re-rolled to: 9,13,9,18,9,9.
> She is a Humanoid (Human), neutral good.
>
> She gains proficiency in Constitution saving throws, Athletics and Nature,
all armour as well as simple and martial weapons.
>
> Amafrey chooses the Defender as her Martial Role.

# Follower adventures

Followers might be encouraged to devote their time to trade, selling magic items aquired by the player,
or huntting down a desired artifact; prayer at a local temple, in service to your shared diety; study,
at an office established by the player or a university; or any other time consuming task that the player
has convinced them is a worthy endeavour.

Followers not dedicated to a task such as these, will likely spend their time
adventuring. Their quests typically asigned by the player they follow and aligned with their goals.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Followers may adventure to:

- Track down and eliminate a group of goblins that fled during their last encounter with the player.

- Scout an area in search of a shrine or enemy encampment.

- Deliver a message of ill omen on behalf of the player.


<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

To determine the success or failure of a follower's adventure, roll on the approprite table below.

Modifiers to the roll include: [Player investment](#p3), [Provided equipment](#p3) and [Adventure difficulty](#p5).

##### Follower adventure: Challenge 0-4
| d100 | Result |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1-30 | Roll on the _Adventure failure: Challenge 0-4_ table in [Appendix A](#p4) |
| 31-79 | Adventure is delayed by d4 (2) days. |
| 80-100+ | Roll on the _Adventure success: Challenge 0-4_ table in [Appendix A](#p4) |

##### Follower adventure: Challenge 5-10
| d100 | Result |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1-40 | Roll on the _Adventure failure: Challenge 5-10_ table in [Appendix A](#p4) |
| 41-79 | Adventure is delayed by d8 (4) days. |
| 80-100+ | Roll on the _Adventure success: Challenge 5-10_ table in [Appendix A](#p4) |

### Preparation

Preparation is often key to the success of an adventure, without which followers might meet an untimely,
and quick, end.

Luck also plays an element, but can be influenced in the right, or wrong,
direction.

<div style='margin-top:100px'></div>

Beyond the [Required starting investment](#p1), any additional funding increases the likelihood
that followers survive to achieve your goals and gain higher levels.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Followers will use any coin provided to prepare themselves with items such a rations and potions, unless directed to do otherwise. The more the player invests in the adventure, the more likely it will be successful.

##### Player investment
| Adventure roll modifier | Player investment |
|:----:|:-------------|
| -5 | None |
| +5 | 20gp |
| +10 | 50gp |
| +20 | 100gp+ |

A _follower item_ is a magic item, or non-magical piece of adventuring gear above 25gp in value, that followers could likely utilise on an adventure increases their overall chance of success.

These could be newly provided or items that the followers are already in the possession of.

##### Provided equipment
| Adventure roll modifier | Number of _follower items_ |
|:----:|:-------------|
| -5 | 0 |
| +5 | 1 |
| +10 | 2 |
| +15 | 3 |
| +20 | 4+ |

- A Warrior sidekick leading a group of followers into a dungeon could be provided with
a [_**potion of healing**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing) and [_**weapon of warning**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/weapon-of-warning), to increase their survivability.
- A Spellcaster sidekick with the Mage _Role_ can be supplied with the materials
necessary to copy new spells into their spellbook.
- An Expert sidekick performing an act of burglary on your behalf could be
given a [_**potion of invisibility**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-invisibility)
to increase their chance of success.

<!-- With guidance from the player and a possible monetary investment followers are better able to take on the challenges posed by an adventure. If not directly supplied with useful magic items such as a [_**potion of healing**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing), followers will use any coin provided to prepare themselves with such items, unless directed to do otherwise. -->

<!-- Followers might be in possession of magic items that they can use in many adventures; this could be a [_**+1 longsword**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/longsword-1) that a follower came into possession of during their last adventure and the player allowed them to keep; or a [_**driftglobe**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/driftglobe) the followers relied upon in their last dungeon delve. -->

## Adventure difficulty

Followers might be pitted against challenges that are comparitively easy or difficult than what would be deemed a suitable challenge for them.

<div class='descriptive'>
To calculate a party of follower's level, take the average level of the group, rounded down, with a minimum of 1.

**Tip**: when the party's level matches the Adventure challenge rating, the difficult modifier is 0.
</div>

##### Adventure difficulty
| Party level | Adventure roll modifier |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1  | 10 x (1 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |
| 2  | 10 x (2 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |
| 3 | 10 x (3 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |
| 4 | 10 x (4 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |

| 10 | 10 x (10 - _Adventure challenge rating_) |

> ##### Party size?

> The exact number of followers is not factored into the _Adventure difficulty_ calculation.
>
> It is assumed that an appropriate number of followers approach the task.

<div style='margin-top:400px'></div>

> ##### Amafrey's first adventure
> Amafrey, a 2nd-level Spellcaster, is adventuring with three companions, all of 1st-level; their party level is 1.
>
> <div style='margin-top:0px; margin-left:20px; font-family:consolas'>(2 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 1.25 = 1</div>
>
> The party have been tasked with locating a shrine known to be hidden in a nearby, relatively safe, forest. The challenge rating of this exploration adventure is 2.
>
> Party level 1 and Adventure challenge rating 2 results in:
>
> <div style='margin-top:0px; margin-left:20px; font-family:consolas'>10 x (1 - 2) = -10</div>
>
> The relatively challenging task of locating this shrine adds a negative 10 modifier to the d100 roll to determining the outcome.
>
> **Tip**: This negative modifier can be offset by _player investment_ and _provided equipment_.

# Class Features

## Artificer

### Ingenious scheme

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Just as followers of yours are about to set out on an adventure, you are struck with an ingenious idea.

You can use _Flash of Genius_ to direct followers to take an otherwise unthought of strategy.

When you do so your follower, or followers, have a chance of completing their adventure in less time,
without affecting their chance of success.

## Barbarian

### Motivated by fear

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can spend a point of rage to... inspire... one of your followers to succeed in their next adventure.

The next time the follower is involved in an adventure that results in rolling on one of the _Follower adventure outcome_ tables in [Appendix A](#p4), you can reroll; you must keep the new role.

## Bard

### Influential network

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You have vouched for a follower of your choice to join a network of bards that can be used to gather,
or propagate, information.

The challenge rating of any Social adventures this follower takes part in,
whilst a member of this network, is decreased by 1.

The influential network might spread misinformation to spook a villain out of hiding;
improve the reputation of individuals that might be running for an election;
or increase the chances of a group obtaining a prized mission when there are multiple
parties interested in receiving the exclusive contract.

## Cleric

### Channel Divinity: Unbreakable devotion

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can use your Channel Divinity to reassert the benefits of devotion to your diety.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and followers that can see or hear you within 30 feet
are bolstered with a divine confidence.

With this your followers will not leave their party out of fear,
possiblly as a result when rolling on an _Adventure failure_ table in [Appendix A](#p4), during their next adventure.

## Druid

### Wild Guide

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to guide followers within 50 miles of you on their travels.
For the next 8 hours they can travel twice as far across any natural ground and ignore difficult terrain.

Your Wild Guide might take the form of a series of bird calls that guide your followers to the clearest paths of a forest,
a steady, sweet smelling, breeze that blows across fields towards a hidden mountain path
or an anmial spirit that travels with the group as long as they remain out of combat.

## Fighter

### Party strategist

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

A follower of yours has received martial training, including strategy.

With this guidance they are an ideal candidate as strategist of their party,
and as such the party tends to be more organised, and successful.

The challenge rating of any Combat adventures this follower takes part in is decreased by 1.

## Monk

### Natural explorer

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

A follower of yours has been taught a deeper appreciation of the surrounding natural environment.

With this guidance they are an ideal candidate as navigator of their party.

The challenge rating of any Exploration adventures this follower takes part in is decreased by 1.

## Rogue

### Unreported adventure

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can direct a follower of your choice to undertake a solo adventure,
drawing from your experience to guide them to success without the reliance of others.

Due to the subtle nature of this kind of mission, you can only have one unreported adventure
in motion at any one time.

An unreported adventure has the same chance of success as a if a small group of followers undertook this mission,
unless the task would suffer significantly, such as requiring multiple events to take place at the same time
in different locations.

An unreported adventure might take the form of an undercover, intelligence gathering mission,
an assassination or burglary, or travel to a location that requires speed and stealth.

## Sorcerer

### ?

_Prerequisite: at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

## Warlock

  style='position:absolute; opacity: 30%; bottom:50px; right:30px; width:280px' />

### Eldritch Invocation Options

When you choose eldritch invocations, you have access to these additional options.

#### Worldly message

_Prerequisite: 10th-level warlock; at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can cast [_**dream**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dream) once,
targeting one of your followers without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

#### Patron of this world

_Prerequisite: 15th-level warlock; at least one recruited follower_
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You can take this eldritch invocation multiple times.
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Rather than wait until your patron extends an offer to those you have recruited,
you strike a bargain with a follower of your choice and become their patron.
Their arcane research and the magic bestowed by you increase, or otherwise grant, them facility with spells.

The creature gains a level, becoming a sidekick Spellcaster with the _Role_ of Prodigy.
Any previous features of another type of sidekick are replaced by those gained as a Prodigy.
Any existing weapon, armour and tool proficiencies remain, with the exception of heavy armour proficiency. The follower retains all gear and equipment.

Having taken this pact with the player, the Prodigy chooses their spells from the warlock spell list.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

As patron of this follower:
- You have advantage on Charsima ability checks, made to guide or convince your Prodigy provided that they can see or hear you within 60 feet.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

You cannot change this eldritch invocation whilst you have a pact with a follower.
If the Profigy you have made a pact with dies, from the next dusk you can offer the pact from this eldritch invocation to
another of your followers.

> #### Prodigy Example: _Amafrey_
> Amafrey has been following the Fathomless Warlock, Luth, for a few tendays; she has the statistics of a 1st-level Warrior sidekick. Amafrey awakes to the strange sensation of an offer of a pact with Luth.
>
> Upon accepting she gains a level and is now a 2nd-level Spellcaster (Prodigy) sidekick.
>
> Amafrey's saving throw proficiency changes from Constitution to Charisma and her skill proficiencies are now: History and Investigation.
>
> Amafrey retains her proficiency with her longsword and medium armour and takes two cantrips from the warlock spell list: [_**booming blade**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/booming-blade) and [_**eldritch blast**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/eldritch-blast). _Amafrey_ey also takes two 1st-level spell from the warlock spell list: [_**armor of agathys**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/armor-of-agathys) and [_**hex**_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hex).

<!-- [The HitPoints section of chapter 1 of the MM (https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/introduction#HitPoints)].
suggest that a Small creature should have a hit die of d6. Looking at a halfling stat block such as https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/manafret-cherryport confirms this.

Whilst the Expert stat block (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/expert) states a d8 it also states a Medium humanoid.

Going by the idea of reworking an existing stat block into a sidekick I think it's safe to assume this has been done for Cade, the Halfling.
